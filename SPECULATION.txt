I found out that if we have less files(don't have those that are in remote Repo) in GIT Repo compared to Github remote Repo we cannot push our GIT Repo to Github remote Repo. We can have more files but not less.

I found out that when we want to push out GIT Repo in Github, we must have atleast the same files that the Github remote Repo has in our GIT Repo. We can have (remote Repo files + extra files) but not less than remote Repo files.

Thus, it is better to pull the remote Repo before pushing GIT Repo.
git pull usually doesn't work properly if the GIT Repo is locally made and pushed to remote Repo because the commit histories do not match.

If we make GIT Repo locally instead of cloning from Github, we have to pull remote Repo in rebase because it makes the history identical to having cloned from remote Repo and making changes in GIT local Repo.
